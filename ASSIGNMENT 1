ASSIGNMENT -1
1) 1) * -> expression
'hello' -> value
-87.8 -> value
- -> expression
/ -> expression
+ -> expression
6 -> value
2) String:
A string is a sequence of characters enclosed within the
single or double quotes.
Can contain any letters, digits, special characters.
Variable:

6) bacon = 22
bacon + 1
For the following code after execution the bacon contains
the value 22.
7) 'spam'+'spamspam' = spamspamspam
'spam'*3 = spamspamspam
8) eggs is a valid variable name while 100 is invalid because
the variable name can start with a letter but not with a digit.
9) int(), float(), str() functions can be used to get the
integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value.
10) 'I have eaten'+99+'burritos'
This expression causes an error because the String and int
type cannot be concatenated.
We can ony concatenate two strings.
So to make the above expression to work we need to convert
the integer type to string type by enclosing the number within
the single or double quotes.
'I have eaten'+'99'+'burritos'
